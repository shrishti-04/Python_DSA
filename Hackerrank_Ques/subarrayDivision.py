# Two children, Lily and Ron, want to share a chocolate bar. Each of the squares has an integer on it.

# Lily decides to share a contiguous segment of the bar selected such that:

# The length of the segment matches Ron's birth month, and,
# The sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birth day.
# Determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.

# Example
# s = [2, 2, 1, 3, 2]
# d = 4
# m = 2

# Lily wants to find segments summing to Ron's birth day, d = 4 with a length equalling his birth month, m = 2. 
# In this case, there are two segments meeting her criteria: [2, 2] and [1, 3].
