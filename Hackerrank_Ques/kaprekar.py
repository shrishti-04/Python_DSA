# A modified Kaprekar number is a positive whole number with a special property. 
# If you square it, then split the number into two integers and sum those integers, you have the same value you started with.

# Consider a positive whole number n with d digits. We square n to arrive at a number that is either 2*d digits long or (2*d)-1 digits long. 
# Split the string representation of the square into two parts, l and r. The right hand part, r must be d digits long. 
# The left is the remaining substring. Convert those two substrings back to integers, add them and see if you get n.

# Example
# n = 5
# d = 1

# First calculate that n^2 = 25. Split that into two strings and convert them back to integers 2 and 5. 
# Test 2+5=7 != 5, so this is not a modified Kaprekar number. If n=9, still d=1, and n^2 = 81. 
# This gives us 8+1=9, the original n.

# In mathematics, a Kaprekar number for a given base is a non-negative integer,
# the representation of whose square in that base can be split into two parts that add up to the original number again.
# For instance, 45 is a Kaprekar number, because 45Â² = 2025 and 20+25 = 45.
