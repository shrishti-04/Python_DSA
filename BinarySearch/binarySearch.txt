Binary Search: It is an operation in which we search any element in given array or any string
from two directions which starts from low to high

┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐
│ 4 │ 2 │ 3 │ 1 │ 2 │
└───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘
┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐
│ 1 │ 2 │ 2 │ 3 │ 4 │
└───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘
  └───────────────┘

 low     mid     high

So, the array will automatically set in sorted manner from ascending to descending order.

The first half direction will be consider as low, before mid element after which the the elements
which are coming after mid element will be consider as high which is second half direction.

Formulae for mid element will be: 
(low + high) // 2, 
will do floor division.

condition will be consider as, target will be given to find any element from the given element
Now, if suppose we want to find 3 from the above array, arr, then we will take target as 3

two condition will be consider for searching target

if(target <= arr[mid]):
    high = mid - 1
else:
    low = mid + 1
