<h1>Python DSA</h1>

<p>This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations in Python. It covers fundamental concepts, problem-solving techniques, and efficient coding practices to strengthen algorithmic skills.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Topics Covered: </b>Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Sorting, Searching, Recursion, and more!</li>
<li><b>Ideal For: </b>Competitive programming, coding interviews, and improving problem-solving skills.</li>

<p>I have also prepared hand written notes, incase if you don't understand any concept you might refer my hand written notes, <br>
Or can directly contact me on my phone number: <b>8208705735</b>, or Mail me: <b>shrishti.st2001@gmail.com</b></p>

<h2>Time Complexity</h2>
<p>Time complexity shows how the execution time of an algorithm increases as the input size grows.</p>

<h2>Hashing</h2>
<p>Hashing is a method of storing and finding data quickly by using a special code (hash) instead of searching through everything.</p>
<p>Here are my hand written notes on Hashing</p>

<h2>Two Pointer</h2>
<p>Two-pointer is an algorithmic technique where two indices (or pointers) traverse a data structure from different positions to optimize time and space complexity.</p>

<h2>Binary Search</h2>
<p>A search algorithm that repeatedly divides a sorted array in half to find a target element in O(log n) time.</p>

<h2>Recursion</h2>
<p>A technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems until a base case is reached.</p>

<h2>Dynamic Programming</h2>
<p>An optimization method that solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant calculations.</p>
