<h1>Python DSA</h1>

<p>This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations in Python. It covers fundamental concepts, problem-solving techniques, and efficient coding practices to strengthen algorithmic skills.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Topics Covered: </b>Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Sorting, Searching, Recursion, and more!</li>
<li><b>Ideal For: </b>Competitive programming, coding interviews, and improving problem-solving skills.</li>

<p>I have also prepared hand written notes, incase if you don't understand any concept you might refer my hand written notes, <br>
